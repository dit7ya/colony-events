** The RoleSet Event can have `revoked` as well as `assigned`
this is not written in the readme but it is clear from here
- https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/blob/develop/contracts/colony/ColonyDataTypes.sol#L40-L43
the ~setTo~ value represents whether assigned or revoked
** The method for getting the date in the readme is full of traps!
- the ~parsedLog~ does not contain info for the date
  - apparently the colony initialization event should have had happened before everything else, right? but there are other events in the same block - so the ordering is unknown to me.
** The CSS requirements in the README is not precise! If I follow the spec exactly it does not look like the given image.
I am not a CSS ninja and I might very well be wrong.

* Notes and Choices
** Date
I decided to display the full date string cause just the date and the month seems like not enough info.
** Browser
- I was having CORS issues with the Infura provider on Firefox. Using Ungoogled-Chromium and/or Brave for dev now. It is an upstream bug apparently, which has been fixed in later versions of ~ethers~. However, this project requires version 4.
** ColonyJs
- I am using the latest version as I was having some issues with the recommended one - ~^2~.
** Parcel v2
- I am using Parcel v2 for this project, partly because there were some weird bugs in the Vite react-ts template, but also because it just had a stable release and I wanted to experiment with it.
- It uses [[https://swc.rs/][swc]] (a fast JS-ecosystem compiler like Esbuild, but written in Rust).
** CSS Modules
- This is the first time I am using CSS modules - usually I go for WindiCSS (a faster Tailwind clone with lots of extra features). However, seems like a CSS modules are really an ergonomic experience in case of React (not much for Svelte cause styles in Svelte are automically local-scoped) - and a very good choice for small projects.
* What I would do if I had more time
** Load Time
- it takes a lot of time to load the data, mainly because there are multiple API calls for various things. I am sure optimizations can be made so that there are less API calls and it loads faster.
- other kinds of possible optimizations -> use loading blocks for things like the date and load the entire app asynchronously
** Refactor the codebase
- extract generic fetching events into a cleaner function
- figure out if any of the provider supports batch queries

** Add tests
** Some extra CSS

* Tasks
** DONE refactor
** DONE add types everywhere
** DONE fix css
** DONE deploy on cloudflare pages
** DONE set up DNS on my domain
** DONE add eslint
** DONE add loading message
** DONE replace Jdenticon with react-blockies
** DONE fix amount value
** DONE figure out all async and promise stuff

* App Flow
- retrieve data for each event type using the API
- parse into the final desirable type
- put into an array
- render
